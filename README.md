Project Description

I took part in a project focused on financial and accounting management. I played an active role in planning accounts, drafting closing entries, and preparing balance sheets and income statements, following international standards IAS/IFRS. Additionally, I tackled the analysis and practical application of operations such as financial leasing, valuation of work in progress, and inventory valuation in accordance with international standards. This experience has provided me with a solid understanding of global accounting and financial practices, preparing me to tackle similar challenges in my future career.
